# G.A.T.

G.A.T. is a development tool for the [Go Programming Language][go]. It automatically runs your tests and hot compiles your code when it detects file system changes.

## Status

This is *early alpha*. There is still quite a lot I'd like to do (Hot Compiles, Growl notifications, and interactions for profiling, benchmarking, etc.). Also, it has only been tested on Mac OS X 10.8.

## Get Going

If you are on OS X, you need to first install GNU Readline via [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/):

``` console
$ brew install readline
```

``` console
$ go get -u github.com/gophertown/gat

$ gat

G.A.T.0.0.1 is now watching your files
Type help for help.

Watching path ./
```

## Autotest

The convention in [Go][] is to use a *counterpart* test file in the same folder. When G.A.T. detects a change to your production code or the test itself, it will run the appropriate test.

If you have a `suite_test.go` in the same folder, G.A.T. will include it in every test run. Use it for a Suite definition (Gocheck, PrettyTest), additional Checkers, or other testing helpers.

## Hot Compiles

...to be determined...

## Interactions

* `a`, `all`, `â†©`: Run all tests.
* `h`, `help`: Show help.
* `e`, `exit`: Quit G.A.T.
