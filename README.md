# G.A.T.

G.A.T. is a development tool for the [Go Programming Language][go]. It automatically runs your tests and hot compiles your code when it detects file system changes.

## Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gophertown/gat.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gophertown/gat)

This is an *early alpha*. There is still quite a lot to do (Hot Compiles, Growl notifications, and interactions for profiling, benchmarking, etc.). Also, it has only been tested on Mac OS X 10.8.

See the public [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/VvblYiSE) for the Roadmap.

## Get Going

If you are on OS X, you need to first install GNU Readline via [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/):

``` console
$ brew install readline
```

To install G.A.T., or to update your installation, run:

``` console
$ go get -u github.com/gophertown/gat
```

Then run `gat` in your project folder:

``` console
$ gat
G.A.T.0.1.1 is now watching your files
Type help for help.

Watching path ./
```

## Autotest

By convention, [Go][] code has a *counterpart* test file in the same folder. When G.A.T. detects a change to your production code or the test itself, it will run the appropriate test.

If you have a `suite_test.go` in the same folder, G.A.T. will include it in every test run. Use it for a Suite definition ([Gocheck][], [PrettyTest][pat]), additional Checkers, or other testing helpers.

## Hot Compiles

...to be determined...

## Interactions

* `a`, `all`, `â†©`: Run all tests.
* `h`, `help`: Show help.
* `e`, `exit`: Quit G.A.T.
